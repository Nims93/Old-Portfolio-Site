          <p>I'm an aspiring web developer / programmer in London</p>
          <p>
            I'm currently mostly into front end development with a strong desire
            to become as proficient and skilled a programmer as possible. I have
            aspirations to learn more languages and frameworks / libraries with
            the ultimate goal to become a full stack developer and mobile dev.
            I'm currently working and skilled with React, Js and SASS.
          </p>
          <p>
            With my current skillset I would like to take my skillset to a
            professional setting with your company, with which I beleive I would
            be an exccellent candidate.
          </p>
